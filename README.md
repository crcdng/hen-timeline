# About HEN timeline

A brief [timeline](timeline.md) of [Hic et Nunc](https://web.archive.org/web/20211107123525/https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/) (abbreviated: HEN or H=N) and [Teia](https://teia.art/).

This timeline captures key moments in the development of Hic et Nunc and beyond, including the evolution of Teia and the wider Tezos art communities.

I fact-check and attempt to keep this timeline as accurate as possible. If you believe in the ideas of second-order cybernetics, however, communication is always based on personal (observer) perspectives (no "objective truths"). Every act of communication therefore includes elements of facts, self-revelation, relationship and appeal. Therefore the timeline cannot be completely unbiased, the inclusion/exclusion of events already constitutes personal curation.

If you spot errors or omissions, contact me on Twitter or file a bug report on Github.
