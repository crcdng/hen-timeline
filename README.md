# HEN timeline

A brief [timeline](timeline.md) of [Hic et Nunc](https://web.archive.org/web/20211107123525/https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/) (abbreviated: HEN or H=N) and [Teia](https://teia.art/).

This timeline captures key moments in the development of Hic et Nunc and beyond, including the evolution of Teia and the wider Tezos art communities.

If you believe in core ideas of second-order cybernetics, communication is based on personal (observer) perspectives. Each act of communication includes elements of facts, self-revelation, relationship and appeal. However, I fact-check and attempt to keep this timeline as accurate as possible. Some entries, however, do contain judgement and commentary. If you spot errors or omissions, contact me on Twitter or file a bug report on Github.
