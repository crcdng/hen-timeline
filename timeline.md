###  Introduction

[Hic et Nunc](https://web.archive.org/web/20211107123525/https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/) (abbreviated H=N, sometimes HEN or hen) is the first NFT art place on the [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) blockchain. This brief timeline is meant to help preserve common memory by capturing some of the key events that led up to the current phenomenon. Therefore it puts focus on H=N itself, not trying to serve as a timeline of blockchains, NFTs or crypto art in general. For these topics some excellent resources are available, e.g:

* https://decal.furtherfield.org/2020/05/22/a-blockchain-art-history-timeline/ by Furtherfield
* https://ostachowski.com/about/what-is-crypto-art-or-nft-art/history-of-crypto-art/ by Martin Lukas Ostachowski
* https://nfttimeline.com/ 

It will be up to everyone individually to make sense of a phenomenon that is operating since March 1, 2021 and has reached 100.000 minted NFTs three months later. Beyond the numbers, the events listed below might provide some clues to the phenomenon: a set of experiments in various directions, an exploding crypto art energy debate, Twitter as a nervous system and amplifier, a frictionless “open for all“ art platform, an eco-friendly Proof-of-Stake blockchain, an emerging and diverse community that includes artists, collectors and hackers. 

However, [this tweet](https://twitter.com/mattmedved/status/1385760755958562816) by Matt Medved captures another aspect of H=N that goes beyond rational analysis and historical explanation. Around the same time in April I [wrote](https://twitter.com/crcdng/status/1386658359290613760) “it feels a bit like the place you visit together after the grand gallery opening to have fun and explore” and shared my [impressions](https://twitter.com/crcdng/status/1386730188654977031)  during the second OBJKT4OBJCT weekend: “a new community of artists and curators is emerging, an art system within the art system”.

This timeline is dedicated to the community.

#### September 23, 2020
“Friends, something has been bugging me for a while”, begins the tweet in which artist Memo Akten addresses deep concerns about the energy usage of crypto art. In the subsequent days and weeks heated debates ensue. Memo subsequently publishes research and a tool to calculate the energy consumption of artworks. The latter was later weaponized against individual artists against the intention of its creator and therefore withdrawn.

H=N “evolved into a tool for creating micro-funding DAOs for any purpose” (xtz.news interview)
https://xtz.news/dao-news/hicetnunc-microfunding-daos-on-tezos/ 
The interview with Rafael Lima gives clues about the name “hic et nunc”, identifiable in Paul Virilio’s writings about a “futurism of the instant”, see for example Virilio, P., & Lotringer, S. (2001). After Architecture: A Conversation. Grey Room, 3, 32–53. doi:10.1162/152638101300138530

Artist and climate activist Joanie Lemercier sheds more light on the energy consumption of Proof-of-Work Ethereum cryptoart platforms. H=N runs on Tezos, a Proof-of-Stake blockchain whose energy impact is neglectable in comparison to Proof-of-Work blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum) according to an article published two days earlier by the Tezos foundation.

#### February 24, 2021
Artist Mario Klingemann mints what appears to be the 112th NFT on H=N: https://twitter.com/quasimondo/status/1364558512286806018. However, this work is among the first 152 NFTs that were created on a different smart contract and therefore have become "invisible". An NFT by Mike Tyka has collected those lost OBJKTs and links to the still available information on them: https://hic.af/objkt/24880

#### March 1, 2021
![](assets/20210301.png)
This date marks the official beginning of H=N, when “swapping OBJKTs” (trading of NFTs in H=N lingo) is possible. At the same time, the governance hDAO token is released.

#### March 26-28, 2021
The first OBJKT4OBJKT event in collaboration with the DiverseNftArt initiative takes place. Artists swap their NFTs for free. The second event in late April attracts even more attention but also reveals the problem of “hoarder bots”, programs written to mass-collect free objects and resell them.

#### March 31, 2021 (Contested)
Artist [@muratpak](https://twitter.com/muratpak) tweets out the first version of what will become, after discussions, the HEN logo, shaping the visual identity of the project: https://twitter.com/muratpak/status/1377312115422343169?s=21. According to artist [@koshino](https://twitter.com/koshino) the logo was created by an Brazilian artist. I try to get the facts, then will update this entry. 

#### April 9, 2021
"Not another JPEG." Artist M Plummer-Fernández shares thoughts about the blossoming (and sometimes stuttering) platform that attracts more and more people critical of mainstream NFT marketplaces. The essay itself is steganographically hidden in an acompanying NFT.

Hickathon, the first H=N hackathon, originates from another tweet by Mario Klingemann, assembles more than 150 participants in 20 groups, who keep working during 24 hours on a wide range of issues such as governance, site features and various improvements. The organisers, receiving overwhelming support from the community and from the Tezos foundation, manage to set up the Hickathon within a week and make it a fun event.

H=N celebrates 100.000 minted NFTs.
https://twitter.com/hicetnunc2000/status/1397724112806633475

#### June 28, 2021
It becomes public knowledge that a logic error in the H=N smart contract which allows an attacker to steal NFTs on the marketplace is actively exploited. In the turbulent fallout of the incident, the selling of NFTs (“swap”) has to be suspended while a new contract is being developed. Effectively this shuts the site down although the creation (“minting”) of new NFTs is still possible without risk. 

Meanwhile, the apparent attacker, who operates under the moniker “hen-exploiter” is engaging with the community, mainly via the H=N discord channel. The ongoing issue also exposes rifts in the H=N community, amidst questions about the development of the site and the parallel opening of another marketplace named objkt.bid (now [object.com](https://objkt.com/)). An AMA (Ask me Anything) event with Rafael Lima brings some insights into the philosophy behind Hic et Nunc.

Tweet by [@mumu_thestan](https://twitter.com/mumu_thestan), July 1

Controversial issues remain, yet members of the community react with a quality that can be observed as its strength: humour. As “hen-exploiter” is supposedly negative on Aubergines, a growing number of Aubergine-shaped NFTs are exchanged directly between artists and collectors under the hashtag [#AUBJKT4AUBJKT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AUBJKT4AUBJKT&src=typed_query).

The H=N functionality is fully restored on July 6, after which all NFT have to be migrated to the new contract (“v2”).

### November 2, 2021
One year after the domain registration, eight months after the first NFTs were swapped on HEN (see above) and amidst some internal and external debate,
the community is celebrating 500.000 OBJKTs (NFTs) on the platform, using the hashtag #hen500k. Also, the community has roughly a size of 50.000 artists and collectors, while around 5.000 visitors engage with Hic et Nunc daily. Community member and prolific coder [@nftbiker](https://twitter.com/NFTBiker) has provided a [tool to access the contributions](https://nftbiker.xyz/event/hen500k?sort=date). 

### November 11, 2021
![](assets/20211111.png)
"discontinued": founder Rafael Lima pulls the plug on the Hic et Nunc website hicetnunc.xyz. 

Due to the decentralized nature of the underlying technology, alternative front-ends such as https://hic.af/, https://www.henext.xyz/, https://objkt.com/ continue running and mirrors of the original site such as http://hen.teztools.io, http://hicetnunc.art, http://hen.hicathon.xyz, http://hicetnunc.cc are spun up within a few hours.
