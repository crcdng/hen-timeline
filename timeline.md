###  Introduction

[Hic et Nunc](https://web.archive.org/web/20211107123525/https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/) (abbreviated H=N, sometimes HEN or hen) is the first NFT art place on the [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) blockchain. This brief timeline is meant to help preserve common memory by capturing some of the key events that led up to the current phenomenon. Therefore it focuses on H=N itself and does not attempt to serve as a timeline of blockchains, NFTs or crypto art in general. These topics are covered in some excellent resources:

* https://decal.furtherfield.org/2020/05/22/a-blockchain-art-history-timeline/ by Furtherfield
* https://ostachowski.com/about/what-is-crypto-art-or-nft-art/history-of-crypto-art/ by Martin Lukas Ostachowski
* https://nfttimeline.com/ 

It will be up to everyone individually to make sense of a phenomenon that, for most people, is operating since March 1, 2021 and reached 100.000 minted NFTs three months and 500.000 eight months later. Beyond the numbers, the events listed below might provide some clues to the phenomenon: a set of experiments in various directions, an exploding crypto art energy debate, Twitter as a nervous system and amplifier, a frictionless “open for all“ art platform, an eco-friendly Proof-of-Stake blockchain, an emerging and diverse community that includes artists, collectors and hackers. 

However, [this tweet](https://twitter.com/mattmedved/status/1385760755958562816) by Matt Medved captures another aspect of H=N that goes beyond rational analysis and historical explanation. Around the same time in April I [wrote](https://twitter.com/crcdng/status/1386658359290613760) “it feels a bit like the place you visit together after the grand gallery opening to have fun and explore” and shared my [impressions](https://twitter.com/crcdng/status/1386730188654977031) during the second OBJKT4OBJCT weekend: “a new community of artists and curators is emerging, an art system within the art system”.

This timeline is dedicated to the community.

#### September 23, 2020
“Friends, something has been bugging me for a while”, begins the tweet in which artist Memo Akten addresses deep concerns about the energy usage of crypto art. In the subsequent days and weeks heated debates ensue. Memo subsequently publishes research and a tool to calculate the energy consumption of artworks. The latter was later weaponized against individual artists against the intention of its creator and therefore withdrawn.

https://xtz.news/dao-news/hicetnunc-microfunding-daos-on-tezos/ 
This interview with Rafael Lima gives not only provides insights into the plans and ideas of the founder, it also gives a clue about the name “hic et nunc”, identifiable in Paul Virilio’s writings about a “futurism of the instant”, see for example Virilio, P., & Lotringer, S. (2001). After Architecture: A Conversation. Grey Room, 3, 32–53. doi:10.1162/152638101300138530

#### February 24, 2021
Artist Mario Klingemann mints what appears to be the 112th NFT on H=N: https://twitter.com/quasimondo/status/1364558512286806018. However, this work is among the first 152 NFTs that were created on a different smart contract and therefore have become "invisible". An NFT by Mike Tyka has collected those lost OBJKTs and links to the still available information on them: https://hic.af/objkt/24880

#### <a name="beginning">March 1, 2021</a> 
![](assets/20210301.png)
This date marks the official beginning of H=N, when “swapping OBJKTs” (trading of NFTs in H=N lingo) is possible. At the same time, the governance hDAO token is released.

#### March 31, 2021 
[@muratpak](https://twitter.com/muratpak) tweets out the first version of what will become, after discussions and adaptions, the HEN logo, thereby shaping the visual identity of the project: https://twitter.com/muratpak/status/1377312115422343169?s=21. Responsible for the design and conceptual studies was artist [Julio Glatt](https://twitter.com/JulioGlatt/status/1461641499087708166?s=20).

#### April 9, 2021
"Not another JPEG." Artist M Plummer-Fernández shares thoughts about the blossoming (and sometimes stuttering) platform that attracts more and more people critical of mainstream NFT marketplaces. The essay itself is steganographically hidden in an acompanying NFT.

#### April 19, 2021 
The inaugural #TheFEN takes place, an event that is eventually a series of 7 coordinated drops which take place between April 19 and June 11. In the words of Juliette Bibasse, they include "pioneers of the digital art scene, in response to the outrageous energy consumption of CryptoArt releases (PoW). Their goal is to encourage the community to transition to #CleanNFT (PoS)." The initiative is curated by Juliette Bibasse and Joanie Lemercier, featuring the further artists beesandbombs (Dave Whyte), Memo Akten, Myriam Bleau, Mike Brondbjerg, Cinzia Campolese, Alex J. Champandard, Raphael de Courville, Ali M Demirel, Cadie Desbiens, Zai Divecha, Diane Drubay, Saskia Freeke, Nettrice Gaskins, Han, Auriea Harvey, Mario Klingemann, Joanie Lemercier, Golan Levin, LIA, Zach Lieberman, Shantell Martin, Kelly Richardson, RubenFro, Helena Sarin, Sasha Stiles, Patrick Tresset, Mike Tyka, Universal Everything, Patricio Gonzalez Vivo and Addie Wagenknecht.

Hickathon, the first H=N hackathon, originates from another tweet by Mario Klingemann, assembles more than 150 participants in 20 groups, who keep working during 24 hours on a wide range of issues such as governance, site features and various improvements. The organisers, receiving overwhelming support from the community and from the Tezos foundation, manage to set up the Hickathon within a week and make it a fun event.

https://twitter.com/hicetnunc2000/status/1397724112806633475

#### June 28, 2021
It becomes public knowledge that a logic error in the H=N smart contract which allows an attacker to steal NFTs on the marketplace is actively exploited. In the turbulent fallout of the incident, the selling of NFTs (“swap”) has to be suspended while a new contract is being developed. Effectively this shuts the site down although the creation (“minting”) of new NFTs is still possible without risk. 

Meanwhile, the apparent attacker, who operates under the moniker “hen-exploiter” is engaging with the community, mainly via the H=N discord channel. The ongoing issue also exposes rifts in the H=N community, amidst questions about the development of the site and the parallel opening of another marketplace named objkt.bid (now [object.com](https://objkt.com/)). An AMA (Ask me Anything) event with Rafael Lima, [published here on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iGMIxTap7A) on July 4, 2021  brings some insights into the philosophy behind Hic et Nunc.

Tweet by [@mumu_thestan](https://twitter.com/mumu_thestan), July 1

Controversial issues remain, yet members of the community react with a quality that can be observed as its strength: humour. As “hen-exploiter” is supposedly negative on Aubergines, a growing number of Aubergine-shaped NFTs are exchanged directly between artists and collectors under the hashtag [#AUBJKT4AUBJKT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AUBJKT4AUBJKT&src=typed_query).

The H=N functionality is fully restored on July 6, after which all NFT have to be migrated to the new contract (“v2”).

### November 2, 2021
One year after the domain registration, eight months after the first NFTs were swapped on HEN (see above) and amidst some internal and external debate, the community celebrates 500.000 OBJKTs (NFTs) on the platform, using the hashtag #hen500k. Also, the community has roughly reached a size of 50.000 artists and collectors, while around 5.000 visitors engage with Hic et Nunc every day. Community member and prolific coder [@nftbiker](https://twitter.com/NFTBiker) has provided a [tool to access the #hen500k contributions](https://nftbiker.xyz/event/hen500k?sort=date). 

### November 11, 2021
![](assets/20211111.png)
"discontinued": founder Rafael Lima pulls the plug on the Hic et Nunc website hicetnunc.xyz. 

Due to the decentralized nature of the underlying technology, alternative front-ends such as https://hic.af/, https://www.henext.xyz/, https://hecticnun.xyz/ or https://objkt.com/ continue running unaffected and mirrors of the original site such as http://hicetnunc.art, http://hen.hicathon.xyz, http://hen.teztools.io, http://hicetnunc.cc spin up within a few hours. 

In an interview in January 2021 (see above), Rafael Lima is quoted as follows: "**We intend to present it as a public blockchain infrastructure, and we are looking into taking it to full decentralization, making it persist beyond even my own will**". The events during and after November 11 appear to confirm this vision.

### December 31, 2021
As the year 2021 draws to a close and a new year is swapped in, many questions remain: what does "Hic et Nunc" mean after November 11? Is Hic et Nunc still alive? Has this timeline stoped or can it be continued after all? Some people seem to assume Hic et Nunc is gone while others have pragmatically replaced the domain suffix ".xyz" by ".art" and kept going. 

At its technical core, Hic et Nunc consists of [a number of smart contracts](https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/objkt-swap) on the Tezos blockchain plus some other stuff on top of it. One contract governs minting - the creation of OBJKTs - the other one, a marketplace contract, controls the subsequent trade of these OBJKTs through swap and collect operations. According to plans in the community, that second contract is going to be replaced by a successor that will redirect future platform fees to the community. Side note: for the sake of transparency, current and future HEN frontends probably should prominently state the contracts they are minting and trading on. 

The "other stuff" includes the storage of NFT assets on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), plus an indexer that caches blockchain information in a database for performance reasons and code for the front end. There is also a governance token called hDAO that has seen some experimental use. Within that structure, what exactly makes up Hic et Nunc as an entity is not exactly clear. However, we are quite comfortable to assign identity to mutable structures like our own bodies, whose elements (cells) are regenerated periodically. I would assume a necessary condition for Hic et Nunc is minting the OBJKT - the NFT - on the Hic et Nunc contract. But is it sufficient?

Apart from that narrow technical view, political, economic and legal aspects such as ownership over a project and issues of intellectual property still raise important concerns. Is it OK for the community to continue the project? Can it use the name "Hic et Nunc", a similiar name or a different name? What should be done about the hDAO ownership token? Who actually is "the HEN community" and who is speaking in its name? Will it be able to transform itself into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), a form of decentralized owenership? Or maybe [alternative models](https://disco.coop/) could be adopted that appear suited to a commons-oriented spirit?  

We might never know, as in the debates on Twitter spaces and Discord we see conflicting interests, fueled by opinion, amplification of the loudest voices, speculation and unsubstantiated claims about the founder's intentions. After numerous heated internal and external discussions, and amidst a difficult and problematic namefinding procedure, this emerging community is still in the process of finding itself before it can rebrand and move on. From a critical perspective it must be acknowledged, that there are much more pressing issues such as concerning FUD and hostility against NFT creators from art establishment figures and fringe groups, while a significant portion of the community's energy seems to be taken up by internalities. 

But it is crucial to look around: each system has its own environment. Hic et Nunc's environment saw a surge of Tezos NFT projects and platforms, notably the NFT metaplatform [Objkt.com](https://objkt.com/) and the generative art experiment [Fxhash](https://www.fxhash.xyz/), the entrance of Tezos NFT art at [Art Basel Miami Beach](https://tezos.com/events/art-basel/) and mainstream NFT platform [Rarible](https://rarible.com/), and a growing number of artist collectives such as [Malaysianft](http://mnft.nfxt.gg/) and [Alterhen](https://alterhen.art/). 

The road into 2022 couldn't be more bumpy, yet exciting. One thing however is clear: It is nonfungible. Take care.

### January 25, 2022
The domain hicetnunc.xyz is reactivated.

### February 2, 2022
The independent HEN community relaunches under its new brand 'Teia' (meaning 'web' in Portuguese). The name was proposed by artist [@globpoderoso](https://twitter.com/globpoderoso) and decided on by the community in two rounds of voting after intense discussions. The rebranding includes the HEN fork https://teia.art/, the Twitter account https://twitter.com/TeiaCommunity, the blog https://blog.teia.art/, the community-run Discord https://discord.gg/C2dD9kxfkJ, the discussion board https://discourse.hencommunity.quest/,  and the Github account https://github.com/teia-community. A launch announcement can be found [here](https://hencommunity.quest/blog/teia-art-launch-announcement).
